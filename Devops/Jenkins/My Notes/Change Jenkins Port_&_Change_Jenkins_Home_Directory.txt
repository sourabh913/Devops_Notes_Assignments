How to change Home Directory of Jenkins
--------------------------------------------
Default home directory path [/var/lib/jenkins]

New Path we want to give is [/home/jenkins_home/jenkins]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) systemctl stop Jenkins (Stop Jenkins Service)

2) mkdir /home/jenkins_home (Create a new Jenkins Home directory using the mkdir command)

3) chown jenkins:jenkins /home/jenkins_home (Change permissions for the new Home directory)

4) cp -prv /var/lib/jenkins /home/jenkins_home (Copy the contents from the old Jenkins Home directory to the new one)

5) usermod -d /home/jenkins_home Jenkins (Assign Jenkins as the user for the new Home directory)

6) vi /etc/default/Jenkins (Open Jenkins configuration file)

7) Scroll down until you reach the JENKINS_HOME entry

Edit the line to include the path to the new Home directory

In our Case 

NAME=jenkins

JENKINS_HOME=/var/lib/$NAME (old home directory path)

JENKINS_HOME=/home/jenkins_home/$NAME (new home directory path)

Esc, then :wq! (Save and Exit the file)

8) vi usr/lib/systemd/system/Jenkins.service (Open Jenkins Service)

Scroll down until you reach the Environment  and Working Directory

Edit the line to include the path to the new Home directory

In our Case

Environment="JENKINS_HOME=/var/lib/jenkins"   [OLD Entry]
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/jenkins

Environment="JENKINS_HOME=/home/jenkins_home/jenkins"  [NEW Entry]
WorkingDirectory=/home/jenkins_home/jenkins

Esc, then :wq! (Save and Exit the file)

9) systemctl daemon-reload (Reload the Daemon)

10) Rename the old Jenkins home directory

    mv /var/lib/Jenkins /var/lib/Jenkins.old

11) systemctl start Jenkins (Start Jenkins Service)

12) Verify the New Home directory under > Manage Jenkins > System > Home directory
