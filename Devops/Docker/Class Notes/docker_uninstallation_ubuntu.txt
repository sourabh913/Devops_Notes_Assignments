Uninstall docker from ubuntu :

sudo systemctl stop docker
Uninstall Docker Packages:

sudo apt-get purge -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo apt-get purge -y docker docker-engine docker.io

Remove Docker Data:
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/containerd

Remove Docker Group (if created):
sudo groupdel docker

Clean Up Unused Packages:
sudo apt-get autoremove -y

Remove Docker Configuration Files (optional):
sudo rm -rf /etc/docker
Verify Removal:

docker --version

If Docker shows a version after youâ€™ve removed it from Ubuntu, it suggests that some Docker-related binaries or components might still be on your system. Here's a systematic approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Check for Remaining Docker Binaries
Docker binaries might still be present in directories such as /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin. Check for these files and remove them if they exist:

sudo find /usr/bin /usr/local/bin -name '*docker*' -type f -exec rm -f {} +

2. Check for Docker Installation via Snap
If Docker was installed via Snap, it might not be removed using apt. Check if Docker is installed as a Snap package:
snap list | grep docker
If Docker is listed, remove it with:
sudo snap remove docker

3. Check for Docker Packages
Verify that no Docker-related packages are installed. Run:
dpkg -l | grep -i docker
If any Docker-related packages appear, remove them:
sudo apt-get purge -y <package_name>

4. Remove Docker Group
Check if the Docker user group still exists and remove it:
sudo groupdel docker

5. Clean Up Docker-related Configuration Files
Ensure that Docker configuration files are removed:
sudo rm -rf /etc/docker

6. Update Package Index and Clean Up
Update your package index and clean up any residual configuration files or dependencies:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get autoremove -y
sudo apt-get autoclean

7. Check System PATH
Ensure that no leftover Docker binaries are in your system PATH:
echo $PATH
Look for directories like /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin where Docker might have been installed and remove any Docker-related files found there.

8. Verify Removal Again
After performing the steps above, check the Docker version again:
docker --version
If you still see Docker's version, the system might be picking up Docker binaries from a different location.

9. Reboot
Sometimes, a reboot can help to clear out any residual processes or cached paths. Reboot your system:
